## Hi 🐟

![GitHub statistics](https://github-readme-stats-bay-phi-38.vercel.app/api?username=andersfischernielsen&show_icons=true&theme=transparent&hide_border=true)

A software engineer based in Copenhagen, in love with software (especially open-source software). 

I'm:
- curious about all programming languages and try to write in as many as possible
- a big fan of working with distributed systems and try to build as many as possible
- passionate about correctness and safety (without getting in the way of development speed)
